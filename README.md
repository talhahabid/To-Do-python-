# To-Do Application

## Description

This program allows users to manage their tasks effectively. Users can:

- Add new tasks with details such as name, date received, and due date.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Remove tasks from their task list.
- Display a list of both unfinished and completed tasks.

The program reads from and writes to a text file (`cps109_a1_output.txt`) to store task details.
